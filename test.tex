  A millisecond pulsar (MSP) is a fast-spinning pulsar whose rotational period is a few 
  milliseconds. MSPs are believed to be old pulsars spun up by their companion stars. PSRs
  J0218+4232, B1821$-$24 and B1937+21 are among the most energetic and fastest-spinning  
  % J0218+4232, B1821âˆ’24 and B1937+21 are among the most energetic and fastest-spinning 
  MSPs. They have been studied in radio, X-ray and gamma-ray bands, and show 
  aligned pulse profile in different energy bands. However, all previous gamma-ray studies 
  were done with previous Fermi LAT Pass 7 data or earlier. The Fermi LAT Pass 8 data was 
  published in 2015 and has substantial improvements, such as increased effective area and 
  wider energy range. Since the recent gamma-ray spectral analyses of the three MSPs are 
  relatively old, I re-analyzed the gamma-ray spectra of the three MSPs with four-year more 
  Fermi LAT observational data and newly published Pass 8 data. Additionally, new X-ray 
  studies of the three MSPs using NuSTAR had been published. I obtained better fit results
  for gamma-ray spectra of the three MSPs with smaller error bars and larger test statistic 
  values. I built a numerical model to explain the high-energy emission from X-rays to 
  gamma-rays based on a two-layer outer gap model. By minimizing the differences between 
  the predictions of the two-layer model and the real data, I fitted three independent 
  parameters of the model. It is found that the simplified two-layer model can predict 
  broadband spectra of the three MSPs which are very close to the observational data from 
  in both X-rays and gamma-rays.
